okay. a website for tests.

so far we've got:
- models for question and choice
- urls, views, and templates for:
  - an index page
  - and a question list page
- a super simple "base" template that the index and question-list pages pull
  from.

the question/choice model we've got right now is going to need to be expanded.
i'm also looking at how to use the django-auth module. i think the final step
is going to be learning to make the website look pretty (b/c right now it's
super boring!)

we need to figure out (well really, lots of stuff, but for now) how to use
forms, how to use the users and auth stuff, and what views we're going to
have.
